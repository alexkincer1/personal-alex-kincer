  According to Costa and McCrae’s Five Factor Model of Personality includes factors such as openness to 
  experiences, consciousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. (Lim) These factors come together to 
  provide correlations that show quite a bit of variety in the importance of life. The first factor of model being
  openness to experiences, this typically involves preferring a routine, being practical vs imaginative, and 
  spontaneous actions. These behaviors are also correlated to feelings of curiosity, flexibility, imagination, 
  intellectual pursuits, becoming interested in new ideas, and obtaining unconventional attitudes. According to the
 textbook, people who are high in the openness to experience category tend to be tolerant of ambiguity (Weiten). 
 The next factor of the model is consciousness, this typically involves impulsive actions, disorganized vs 
 disciplined, and being careful. These behaviors are correlated to feelings of being diligent, well-organized, 
 punctual, and dependable. People scoring high in the consciousness factor are usually able to regulate themselves 
 effectively and are very organized in their lives. The third factor of the model is extraversion, this typically 
 involves being reserved, thoughtful vs socialable, and fun-loving. These behaviors are correlated with feelings of
  friendliness, excitement, explorative, and upbeat. Typically, those scoring high in this factor can maintain a 
  positive outlook on their lives and the lives of people around them. The next factor of the model is 
  agreeableness, typically involving behaviors of suspicion, uncooperating vs trustworthiness, and helpfulness to 
  others. These behaviors are associated with feelings of sympathy, trust, cooperation, and humbleness. People 
  scoring higher in this factor are also associated with empathy and helping behaviors for others. The final factor
  is neuroticism, and can be described as calm, confident vs anxious, and sometimes even pessimistic. These 
  behaviors are correlated with feelings of anxiety, hostility, self-consciousness, insecurity, and vulnerability. 
  People scoring highest in this factor are typically more self-conscious about themselves and unable to control 
  their emotions effectively. All of these factors come together and have the ability to determine the personality 
  type of any given person, with only measuring the basic traits that have been identified. 


  The ORIGINAL IPEP online quiz made to make conclusions on personalities using the Five Factor Model ended up being very accurate for me. In openness to experience, I got a very low score of a 6, with a sub score of 26 in being adventurous. I agree with this because of how I live my daily life almost walking on eggshells with the thought of trying something new. For example, I honestly cannot remember the last time I tried a new food. For at least the last 5 years, I have had the same meal of pinto beans and Velveeta macaroni mixed for lunch and/or dinner at least 2 times a week, most of the more. In conscientiousness, I scored a low 30, this explaining that I am not very organized, which could not be a truer statement. I have officially been back from Fall break since early Sunday, and my clothes and beauty products have been unpacked, but are currently scattered on my floor. My extraversion score also came out to a low 34, meaning that I have an average social battery. I am a cheerleader, so I do have my moments where I am put out there and socialize while having many eyes on me with absolutely no problem. However, I also have moments where I am horribly embarrassed by the smallest amount of attention. For example, in Psychology class, I popped my elbow during lecture, which is a normal thing for me, and Dr. Singer heard and drew attention to the sound. Once it was pointed out and I felt the eyes of the class on me, my entire face flushed with redness, and it was painfully noticeable to Dr. Singer that I had been embarrassed by such a small announcement. To add onto the accuracy, my agreeableness score was a low 20, indicating that I am viewed as tough and critical. I believe this is accurate because of how unwavering I become when discussing topics that my ground needs to be stood in. For example, my sub score of morality was 36, I believe I have strong standpoints on all my morals that guide my life and define my personality. Finally, my neuroticism score was an average 56, indicating that I can handle stressful situations and cope efficiently with most emotions. For example, in the Summer of 2019, I was going into my sophomore year of high school and experienced my first, very close death. The 9-year-old little sister of my best friend suddenly passed away riding her 4-wheeler in their front yard. Though I struggled in the beginning of trying to find my emotions, my dad reminded me that I needed to be there for my friend and that it would all be okay. This event shaped my coping mechanisms which leads me to believe that this score is accurate. Overall, I feel this quiz was an accurate description of my personality.
