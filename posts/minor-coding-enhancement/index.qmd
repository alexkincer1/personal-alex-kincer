## Introduction

While working on my Website Warmup for CSC324 at Georgetown College, I did not enjoy looking at a black and white website. So, I used [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html) to study actions and color options usuable in VSCODE. 


## How I Did It

In your `_quarto.yml` file, get within your format section that indicates all aspects of the layout of your website. The first options I chose to use were "fontcolor" that sets the default color of all texts in the documents being showcased in the website. The second option I chose was "linkcolor" which sets the default color of all the hyperlinks being placed within the text.

```{.yml filename="_quarto.yml"}
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    mainfont: 1.5rem
    fontcolor: 
    linkcolor: 
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
    footnotes-hover: true
```

Then I chose the shade of pink I wanted to use - "#d63384" - and entered it after the colon to assign it.

```{.yml filename="_quarto.yml"}
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    mainfont: 1.5rem
    fontcolor: "#d63384"
    linkcolor: "#d63384"
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
    footnotes-hover: true
```

This is how I made this website you are reading's text hot pink!
