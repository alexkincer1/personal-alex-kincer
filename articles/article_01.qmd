### What does Resilience Really Mean?

Resilience in the light of stress is the ability to handle and push through adversities full of stress, trauma, and hardships. By building resilience, a person can improve their social qualities, improve achievements, and cause better outcomes under pressure. Overall, resilience plays a significant role in personal growth and achievements.

### What happened when I persevered?

Being a member of the Georgetown College cheer team, over the course of summer break 2023, I was given strength-based workouts to become a stronger base for the competition team. So, after completing all the workouts and gaining around 10lbs of muscle, I walked into the first practice session of the year and my coach decided that we needed another flyer to go in the air. After looking at the team, Coach Joanie announced that she thinks I should be the next flyer to go in the air, even though I had put in all of the effort to be a base over the summer. I hadn’t been put up since I was in middle school and had gained at least 30lbs since then as well. However, due to being on scholarship and trying to be a team player, I agreed and attempted. Though I had been put in a stressful situation full of the adversities between me and the rest of the girls that had been flying their entire lives, I pushed through using resilience and ended up making the competition team as a first-time flyer and out-performed 3 other flyers. This situation caused a lot of stress to be put on me and put my body and mental health through very many hardships and battles. However, pushing through gave me the best outcome I could’ve gotten, and I will continue to build my resilience and overcome such battles. 

## What about when I don't push through?

Though resilience building seems to be an easy thing to achieve with all the negative things in the world today, many situations can have an alternate route that is more of an easy-way-out. For example, I started the Fall 2023 semester taking 15 credit hours, and only needing 10 passing hours to be eligible for competitive cheer. With this frame of wiggle room for classes, I began to fall behind and get very poor grades in History of Christianity. Instead of challenging myself to succeed by pushing through, I dropped the course to stay eligible and continue my competition season. This scape goat of dropping the course did not build resilience, but rather showed me that the easier ways out can also be beneficial in the moment, such as eligibility, but could also render your success, as to the fact that I will still be required to take another religion course to graduate from Georgetown. 

## Are there any practices for building resilience?

With resilience being able to be utilized in almost every stressful corner of life, simple steps can be taken to aid this action. Simple things such as asking for help from support systems to complete goals, staying focused, and believing in yourself are some of the easiest things you can do to build yourself up. In addition, building peers up with constant support, encouraging words, or having their back when they need a boost or shoulder to cry on to let it all out and keep moving forward can build resilience in seconds. In conclusion, resilience is a phenomenal quality to have when working towards success and there are so many things that will move you and others towards their goals and make everyone’s lives easier with having so much of it to use!
