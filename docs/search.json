For example, I started the Fall 2023 semester taking 15 credit hours, and only needing 10 passing hours to be eligible for competitive cheer. With this frame of wiggle room for classes, I began to fall behind and get very poor grades in History of Christianity. Instead of challenging myself to succeed by pushing through, I dropped the course to stay eligible and continue my competition season. This scape goat of dropping the course did not build resilience, but rather showed me that the easier ways out can also be beneficial in the moment, such as eligibility, but could also render your success, as to the fact that I will still be required to take another religion course to graduate from Georgetown."

    "text": "Are there any practices for building resilience?\nWith resilience being able to be utilized in almost every stressful corner of life, simple steps can be taken to aid this action. Simple things such as asking for help from support systems to complete goals, staying focused, and believing in yourself are some of the easiest things you can do to build yourself up. In addition, building peers up with constant support, encouraging words, or having their back when they need a boost or shoulder to cry on to let it all out and keep moving forward can build resilience in seconds. In conclusion, resilience is a phenomenal quality to have when working towards success and there are so many things that will move you and others towards their goals and make everyone’s lives easier with having so much of it to use!"

Neon is as eastern as you can get, being less than 10 minutes from the Virginia line. Being that close to Virginia, I have always been surrounded by mountains, so Georgetown was a very different atmosphere. If the description above hasn’t given you an idea of where I’m from, I was greatly affected in the Summer of 2022 Eastern Kentucky flooding.\n\nThe photo above was taken from my grandparents’ front porch the morning after the first round of flooding. Due to being from the poverend area of Appalachia and the now flooded area, I longed to get out of the mountains and make something of myself that would put me in the place to not need to move back. I love where I am from, and my family will always be there, but the mountains are not my forver home."

Less than 10 minutes later, school was cancelled for the next week. Normally, a call of school being cancelled would be something I forgot within the hour, however, episodic memory, a memory remembered vividly due to the high emotions that took place during the creation of the memory, took over my body and will be something I will never forget.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Randi A. Kincer\n  Georgetown College\n  PSY 111 : General Psychology\n  Dr. Rebecca Singer\n  October 2, 2023\nAccording to Costa and McCrae’s Five Factor Model of Personality includes factors such as openness to experiences, consciousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. (Lim) These factors come together to provide correlations that show quite a bit of variety in the importance of life. The first factor of model being openness to experiences, this typically involves preferring a routine, being practical vs imaginative, and spontaneous actions. These behaviors are also correlated to feelings of curiosity, flexibility, imagination, intellectual pursuits, becoming interested in new ideas, and obtaining unconventional attitudes. According to the textbook, people who are high in the openness to experience category tend to be tolerant of ambiguity (Weiten). The next factor of the model is consciousness, this typically involves impulsive actions, disorganized vs disciplined, and being careful. These behaviors are correlated to feelings of being diligent, well-organized, punctual, and dependable. People scoring high in the consciousness factor are usually able to regulate themselves effectively and are very organized in their lives. The third factor of the model is extraversion, this typically involves being reserved, thoughtful vs socialable, and fun-loving. These behaviors are correlated with feelings of friendliness, excitement, explorative, and upbeat. Typically, those scoring high in this factor can maintain a positive outlook on their lives and the lives of people around them. The next factor of the model is agreeableness, typically involving behaviors of suspicion, uncooperating vs trustworthiness, and helpfulness to others. These behaviors are associated with feelings of sympathy, trust, cooperation, and humbleness. People scoring higher in this factor are also associated with empathy and helping behaviors for others. The final factor is neuroticism, and can be described as calm, confident vs anxious, and sometimes even pessimistic. These behaviors are correlated with feelings of anxiety, hostility, self-consciousness, insecurity, and vulnerability. People scoring highest in this factor are typically more self-conscious about themselves and unable to control their emotions effectively. All of these factors come together and have the ability to determine the personality type of any given person, with only measuring the basic traits that have been identified.\nThe ORIGINAL IPEP online quiz made to make conclusions on personalities using the Five Factor Model ended up being very accurate for me. In openness to experience, I got a very low score of a 6, with a sub score of 26 in being adventurous. I agree with this because of how I live my daily life almost walking on eggshells with the thought of trying something new. For example, I honestly cannot remember the last time I tried a new food. For at least the last 5 years, I have had the same meal of pinto beans and Velveeta macaroni mixed for lunch and/or dinner at least 2 times a week, most of the more. In conscientiousness, I scored a low 30, this explaining that I am not very organized, which could not be a truer statement. I have officially been back from Fall break since early Sunday, and my clothes and beauty products have been unpacked, but are currently scattered on my floor. My extraversion score also came out to a low 34, meaning that I have an average social battery. I am a cheerleader, so I do have my moments where I am put out there and socialize while having many eyes on me with absolutely no problem. However, I also have moments where I am horribly embarrassed by the smallest amount of attention. For example, in Psychology class, I popped my elbow during lecture, which is a normal thing for me, and Dr. Singer heard and drew attention to the sound. Once it was pointed out and I felt the eyes of the class on me, my entire face flushed with redness, and it was painfully noticeable to Dr. Singer that I had been embarrassed by such a small announcement. To add onto the accuracy, my agreeableness score was a low 20, indicating that I am viewed as tough and critical. I believe this is accurate because of how unwavering I become when discussing topics that my ground needs to be stood in. For example, my sub score of morality was 36, I believe I have strong standpoints on all my morals that guide my life and define my personality. Finally, my neuroticism score was an average 56, indicating that I can handle stressful situations and cope efficiently with most emotions. For example, in the Summer of 2019, I was going into my sophomore year of high school and experienced my first, very close death. The 9-year-old little sister of my best friend suddenly passed away riding her 4-wheeler in their front yard. Though I struggled in the beginning of trying to find my emotions, my dad reminded me that I needed to be there for my friend and that it would all be okay. This event shaped my coping mechanisms which leads me to believe that this score is accurate. Overall, I feel this quiz was an accurate description of my personality."

The first options I chose to use were “fontcolor” that sets the default color of all texts in the documents being showcased in the website. The second option I chose was “linkcolor” which sets the default color of all the hyperlinks being placed within the text.\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    mainfont: 1.5rem\n    fontcolor: \n    linkcolor: \n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true\n    footnotes-hover: true\n\nThen I chose the shade of pink I wanted to use - “#d63384” - and entered it after the colon to assign it.\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    mainfont: 1.5rem\n    fontcolor: \"#d63384\"\n    linkcolor: \"#d63384\"\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true\n    footnotes-hover: true\n\nThis is how I made this website you are reading’s text hot pink!"
